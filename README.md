# Fall-2025-Campus-DoorDash
A full-stack application designed for the UMBC community, providing an on-campus food delivery service similar to DoorDash but limited to campus locations. Students, faculty, and staff can order from on-campus dining spots, while student workers deliver orders during their free time.
