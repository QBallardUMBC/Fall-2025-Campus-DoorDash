# Fall-2025-Campus-DoorDash
A full-stack application designed for the UMBC community, providing an on-campus food delivery service similar to DoorDash but limited to campus locations. Students, faculty, and staff can order from on-campus dining spots, while student workers deliver orders during their free time.

Backend
Oluwatobiloba Abidoye was our primary backend developer. 
We chose go for our backend for performance reasons primarily and how easily it integrates with stripe for payments. 
Postgres/Supabase was our choice for database. It made authentication significantly easier to implement than rolling our own auth.  
Stripe is the market leader when it comes to payment apis so we went with the standard. 
Project is approximately 80 percent done on the backend side.
